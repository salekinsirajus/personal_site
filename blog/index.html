  <h3>Background</h3>
<p>For the past one and a half year working as both a developer and a user, I learned a few lessons about the usability of a REST API. There are times I cursed the developer who implemented such a useless mess. Other times I patted myself on the back for coming up with such a brilliant application. So here goes the list of things I should do right the next time around. Note that most of these observations are common sense but easy to forget.</p>
<h3>The List</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Don’t return everything from one endpoint. What is the point of an endpoint (or any program, for that matter) that does everything?</p>

  <p><code>netcat</code> is a quite powerful tool, and it can be used for almost anything under the sun related to TCP/IP
networking. I needed the simplest web server once to render some HTML and CSS files
but did not have a way to open those files directly from a browser window.  <code>netcat</code> came very handy,
and I was surprised how powerful yet simple this tool was.</p>
<p>If you find yourself in the same situation, you can fire up a simple HTTP server with <code>netcat</code>.
Here's a little guide for you:</p>
<hr>
<p>Make a shell script with whatever commands you want to run when you make request.
You potentially <strong>could</strong> run a full-blown webserver with this script,...

  <p>I have a confession to make first: I should have started using unittests more seriously a while ago. Sure, I would use a something like a <code>tmp.py</code> and test the script with a bunch of different inputs and make sure they all work. But this does not make sure you take care of all--or at least the critical ones--and don't break the program trying to fix another bug. Anyway, I encountered a bunch of problems while trying to get started with unittesting. And there weren't many examples out there that I could follow: most of them either are too simplistic, or too complex. So I thought I would write a post on this for someone in my shoes who might find this useful.</p>

  <p>When I was trying to build the basic version of this site, I got stuck particularly on the front page. I just thought of making it look pretty neat so I wanted to basically write raw HTML in the <code>contents.lr</code> file. (Context: in lektor CMS, the idea is basically put the data in a UTF-8 encoded text file, with <code>.lr</code> extension, model it according to the model provided which basically describes what fields and data types a page is gonna have, and finally render with template file that has <code>.html</code> extension.)</p>
<p>However, I could not really get this damn page to render correctly. I was adding HTML divs, and trying to use Bootstrap columns etc etc. The first part of it was...

  <p>I have been working on this project sporadically. I work on it a day or two, then forget about it, and then come back again in another two to three weeks. Right now, I'm trying to give this site somewhat decent look, but holy mother of god, it's such a pain in the ass to do the work of a designer when you've never done design work.  I just don't want it to look it super ugly: if it doesn't get me hired that's fine, but I don't want it to repel the visitors.</p>
<p>I'm using bootstrap, and added Font Awesome, which has a very cool collection of icons. I also added bootstrap-social to give the social media buttons a polished look. I'm looking into Material Design and Color Theory stuff right now to see if there's...

  <p>A custom car stereo system built using Raspberry Pi with Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) as the
operating system.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I had my first car two months ago, and it's a classic beater: Chevy Cavalier. It comes with a stock
radio and perhaps CD player, but that's about it. So I planned on adding an onboard computer
for navigation and entertainment. I bought a Raspberry Pi model 3 B, and I will document my
journey as I install a custom stereo to my old beater.</p>
<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>So far I gathered the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi Model 3 B</li>
<li>MicroSD card to burn the OS image to</li>
<li>USB Keyboard </li>
</ul>
<p>I'm going to need some...

  <p>School starts in a few days, and I will be starting the final semester of my undergraduate degree.
I came to Earlham about three and a half years ago with eyes full of dreams. Now I'm getting out
with a more accurate understanding of my abilities, future plans, and a lot of uncertainties. 
Initially I wanted to get a degree in CS and Physics; however, I dropped Physics halfway 
through my junior year as a major so that I could focus more on CS. 
As a result, I will hopefully graduate with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Physics
in May of 2018.</p>
<p>Looking at my college experience as a whole, however, I'm bound to say that the vast majority of
the learning came from outside the classrooms. I learned...
